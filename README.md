**Description**
This project implements a full-stack private chat system enabling users to send photos and text messages with minimal authentication. Users can send private text and image messages in real-time and receive unread message notifications. The app uses Socket.IO for real-time communication and MySQL to persist user data and messages.

Note: The feature to block or unblock other users is not implemented yet.
